for some reason the page was not displaying images even though all the codes is there and refers to the correct files and location of the images.  I tried changing the source from main, to none, as recommended by my TA.  Then changed it back from none to main again.  But now the link does not bring the page up at all, only a 404 error code.  So I'm going to try to push up again to github. 

this is a new repository named advanced_css_homework2_v2.  the original one would not load after changing source as stated above.
